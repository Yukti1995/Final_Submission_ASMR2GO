# Final_Submission_ASMR2go
Capstone project to help people reduce stress levels, improve insomnia and mood by live recording and playing of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Responsive voices. ASMR is an brain-tingling feeling and hence our initiative is to bring this model for people to have greater access to this experience and can overcome insomnia.
