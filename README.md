# Final_Submission_ASMR2go
Capstone project to help people reduce stress levels, improve insomnia and mood by live recording and playing of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Responsive voices. ASMR is an brain-tingling feeling and hence our initiative is to bring this model for people to have greater access to this experience and can overcome insomnia. 


# Design Implementation 
Qt Creator, is a C++ cross-platform for developing multimedia GUI application. We compile the C++ code as well as design the simultaneous GUI app for the ASMR2go live recording and playing mechanism.
