The team would like to thank their mentor Dr.Takis Zourntos for his guidance and techniques without which the project would not have reached its final destination. Moreover the team would like to thank You tube-A.S.M.R influencers for their guidance and techniques, may the project reach and enlighten millions of souls like they do. A special thanks to Ved Patel, grade 7 student, for providing sweet voice in one of the audio device-‘The lullaby’. 
At the current time of Pandemic, the team recognise and support the frontline workers and hospital staff for their bravery and enthusiasm to fight the disease.
Last but not the least we remember and the Almighty! May his shower of blessings keeps falling on all of the life on the earth……
