                                                       The Idea
In the year 2010, Jennifer Allen was searching through the videos of cosmic space, when she felt a tingling sensation across her spine. It provided a vibe of sensation which she always used to feel whenever she listened to similar soothing noises but never noticed about them until that time. 
Later she started a blog where she shared her experience about the sensational feeling from the sound of space. To her surprise, people begin to notice this feeling and they all shared their own similar experiences with different other form of sound.  This let to a discovery that human can have sensational felling from a typical frequency of sound which triggers their sensory and motor nervous system of their brain. The sound can be any simple thing like brushing of hair, folding of sheets, and sound of rain or ‘The Whisper’. 
In the year 2010, Allen did establish her company and did debut on Steady Health under the name: A.S.M.R Group. The A.S.M.R stands for:
A-Autonomous: feeling from within.
S-Sensory: for the sensation.
M-Meridian: peak, orgasm and energy pathways of traditional Chinese medicine.
R-Response: Reaction to the set of stimuli.[ CITATION Jam19 \l 4105 ]
The main motto of the company was to introduce the world to different kinds of soothing and sensational sounds which would trigger their sensory motor nerves and relax anyone who listens to them. 
Today ASMR has become a YouTube phenomenon with over a hundred YouTube stars featuring in ASMR videos, each having millions of followers. 
ASMR has proven to be a new field of study which can be used to relax ourselves and heal ourselves from mental problems.
